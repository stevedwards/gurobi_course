    "The maximum flow minimum cut problem holds a special place in the history of optimization theory. We will first model the problems as Linear Programs and use the results to discuss some somewhat surprising results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems consider a directed graph consisting of a set of nodes and a set of labeled arcs. The arc labels are non-negative values representing a notion of capacity for the arc. In the node set, there exists a source node $s$ and a terminal node $t$. The amount of flow into one of the intermediary nodes must equal the amount of flow out of the node, i.e., flow is conserved. \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum flow question asks: what is the maximum flow that can be transferred from the source to the sink. The minimum cut question asks: which is the subset of arcs, that once removed would disconnect the source node from the terminal node, which has the minimum sum of capacities. For example, removing arcs $(C, t)$ and $(D, t)$ from the network below would mean there is no longer a path from $s$ to $t$ and the sum of the capacities of these arcs is $140 + 90 = 250$. It is reasonably straight forward to find a better cut, i.e., a subset of nodes with sum of capacities less than 250.\n",
